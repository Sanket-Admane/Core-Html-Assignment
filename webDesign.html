    <h1>Web Design</h1>

    <p>
      Web development refers to the process of creating websites and web applications. This 
      involves a combination of different technologies and programming languages, such as HTML, 
      CSS, and JavaScript, to create web
      pages and make them interactive.
      <br />

      Web development can be divided into two main categories: front-end development and 
      back-end development. Front-end development deals with the visual aspects of a website or 
      application, including the design, layout, and user interface. This involves working with 
      HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web pages that can be viewed in a browser.
